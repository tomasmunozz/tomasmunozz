I am a Software Developer with experience in business process automation and web development. During my internship, I acquired skills in process automation, worked on projects using agile methodologies and BPMS, and utilized Microsoft Power Platform. I developed cloud automations with Power Automate, Power Apps, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agents.

Additionally, I handled data integration from sources like SharePoint, Excel, and SQL. In the realm of web development, I have experience in programming logic using JavaScript, React, and Vue. I am also proficient in Spring Boot, Python, Postman, HTML, and CSS.
